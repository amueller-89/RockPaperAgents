# RockPaperAgents
a project to learn web development by implementing a FastAPI-backend with database integration through sqlAlchemy and an SPA-frontend in HTML and javascript. I created a funcitonal platform that allows user to create password-secured accounts or play as guests, participate in a public chat or send private messages, and play each other in RockPaperScissors.
